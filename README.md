# Demo of an attack on the runner

In this demo attacker will use another `pull_request` trigger to change the workflow and add the
local runner to this modified workflow.

## Potential attack

Attacker can get access to the self-hosted runner. Thanks to that attacker can easily scan internal
networks or other private resources on the network or use the machine power for crypto mining or
DDoS attacks.

## Setup

See `main` branch for how to connect your local runner.
